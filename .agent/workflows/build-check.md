# Build Check

// turbo-all

1. Run the TypeScript + Vite build:
```
npm run build
```

2. If the build succeeds, report success to the user.

3. If the build fails, read the error output carefully. Identify the file, line number, and error type. Report a clear summary to the user with suggested fixes.
